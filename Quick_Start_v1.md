#### What is it? 

FX Framework is a FileMaker Add-on scripting structure and methodology which is transactional, extensible, and fully error-trapped. 

It contains a library of commonly-needed functions which allow the developer to concentrate on building out their business logic, instead of repeatedly rewriting an error-trapping field setter for each file (for example).

- FX Framework will install:
	- Tables
	- Relationships
	- Layouts
	- Custom Functions
	- Sripting

- FX Framework will NOT install:
	- Security
	- Value Lists
	- External Data Sources
	- Containers or a Container directory structure
	- Custom Menus
	- Themes

#### Why use it? 

FX Framework has many advantages over common FileMaker scripting methodologies:
- The FX Framework can be installed as an Add-on for every file in a new or existing solution.
- Data editing functions are fully transactional and able to be rolled back if they encounter any errors
- Results are returned in a predictable JSONObject format.
- Errors are consistently trapped and returned in a predictable JSONObject format.
	- Any trapped errors include the full error stack â€” from the calling script all the way down to the subscript that encountered the error.
- Scripts are easily versioned and can also be rolled back if testing proves the new version is not working as expected.

#### How is it installed?

Instructions:
- Open the FX Framework file and run the Make Add-on script which will ask from which window to create the app (type for example, "Fx Library v3")

- Choose to replace UUID, and confirm it. %% (Is this correct Kaz?) %%
- Open the destination file
- Enter Layout Mode
	- Enable the left pane and click the Add-ons tab

- Click the "+" button

- Then confirm that it worked

- The most obvious sign that FX Framework was installed successfully will be the extensive folder structure under the FX folder in the Manage Scripts Menu.

#### RTFM!

First thing to note is that the Framework is fully self-documenting and the documentation of any script can be obtained by calling that script with this JSON call:

```
JSONSetElement ( "{}" ; "fx_options" ; True ; JSONBoolean ) 
```

For example:

```
Perform Script [Specified: From list; "sub: simple email (fxp)" ; Parameter: JSONSetElement ( "{}" ; "fx_options" ; True ; JSONBoolean ) ]
```

Which will produce a documentation JSONObject:

```

	"begin" : {},
	"end" : {},

	{
		"display" : false,
		"revert" : false
