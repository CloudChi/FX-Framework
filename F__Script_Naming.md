# Script Naming

- Script names start with a 3-letter prefix which determines **HOW** they should be called
  - Script prefix definitions:
    - sched > Schedule
      - Called by FileMaker server
    - exp > Export
      - XXX
    - imp > Import
      - YYY    
    - btn > Button
      - Called by Buttons on Layouts
      - Displays errors
    - trg > Trigger
      - Called by Script Triggers
      - Returns "False" if errors
      - Returns "True" if no error 
        - (Why is this, since it should be top level???)
    - sub > Subscript
      - Called as a subscript
      - Never called as top level 
      - Passes back results or errors in JSON format
      - Does not display errors
      - Can be found in various Module subfolders (unlike other prefixes)
        - Private
        - Protected
        - Public
        - Export
        - Dependencies
      - Can be found in various Non-Module folders (unlike other prefixes)
        - Schedules
        - Import
        - Triggers (file level)
    - dpr > Deprecated
      - Deprecated, so should NEVER be called by any other script
      - Can be any type previously
    - (BLANK) > Procedures
      - Called by Scripts Menu > Menu Items
      - They need to be human readable, so therefore no Prefix
      - Displays errors
