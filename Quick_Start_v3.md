## FX Framework Add-on

#### What is it? 

FX Framework is a FileMaker Add-on scripting structure and methodology which is transactional, extensible, and fully error-trapped. 

It contains a library of commonly-needed functions which allow the developer to concentrate on building out their business logic, instead of (for example) repeatedly rewriting an error-trapping field setter for each file.

- FX Framework will install:
	- Tables
	- Relationships
	- Layouts
	- Custom Functions
	- Sripting

- FX Framework will NOT install:
	- Security
	- Value Lists
	- External Data Sources
	- Containers or a Container directory structure
	- Custom Menus
	- Themes

#### Why use it? 

FX Framework has many advantages over common FileMaker scripting methodologies:
- The FX Framework is installed as an Add-on for every file in a new or existing solution.
- Data editing functions are fully transactional and able to be rolled back if they encounter any errors
- Results are returned in a predictable JSONObject format.
- Errors are consistently trapped and returned in a predictable JSONObject format.
	- Any trapped errors include the full error stack â€” from the calling script all the way down to the subscript that encountered the error.
- Scripts are easily versioned and can also be rolled back if testing proves the new version is not working as expected.

#### Was the Add-on installed?

In the Script Workspace, look for an FX folder with many subfolders to confirm that the Add-on was installed successfully.

#### RTFM!

The scripts in the FX Framework are fully self-documenting by calling any of them with this parameter:

```
JSONSetElement ( "{}" ; "fx_options" ; True ; JSONBoolean ) 
```

For example:

```
Perform Script [Specified: From list; "sub: simple email (fxp)" ; Parameter: JSONSetElement ( "{}" ; "fx_options" ; True ; JSONBoolean ) ]
```

Which will produce a documentation JSONObject:

```
{
	"begin" : {},
	"end" : {},
	"error_handling" : 
	{
		"display" : false,
		"revert" : false
	},
	"parameters" : 
	{
		"paths" : 
		{
			"attachment_path" : 
			{
				"description" : "path to the item to attach",

				"type" : "JSONString",
				"variable_type" : "text"
			},

			{
