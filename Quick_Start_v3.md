## FX Framework Add-on

#### Overview 
The FX Framework is a FileMaker Add-on which provides developers with a scripting structure that supports the following critical functions for any coding environment:

- stacked transactions
- script version testing and simple 
- full error trapping / returning

These strengths enable developers to focus on their business logic, rather than constantly having to rebuilding common scripts. The Framework Add-on only installs:

- Tables
- Relationships
- Layouts
- Custom Functions
- Scripting

#### Benefits

FX Framework has many advantages over common FileMaker scripting structures and methodologies:
- The FX Framework is installed as an Add-on for every file in a new or existing solution.
- Data editing functions are fully transactional and able to be rolled back if they encounter any errors
- Results are returned in a predictable JSONObject format.
- Errors are consistently trapped and returned in a predictable JSONObject format.
	- Any trapped errors include the full error stack â€” from the calling script all the way down to the subscript that encountered the error.
- Scripts are easily versioned and can also be rolled back if testing proves the new version is not working as expected.

#### Was the Add-on installed?

In the Script Workspace, look for an FX folder with many subfolders to confirm that the Add-on was installed successfully.

#### RTFM!

The scripts in the FX Framework are fully self-documenting by calling any of them with this parameter:

```
JSONSetElement ( "{}" ; "fx_options" ; True ; JSONBoolean ) 
```

For example:

```
Perform Script [Specified: From list; "sub: simple email (fxp)" ; Parameter: JSONSetElement ( "{}" ; "fx_options" ; True ; JSONBoolean ) ]
```

Which will produce a documentation JSONObject:

```

	"begin" : {},
	"end" : {},
	"error_handling" : 
	{
		"display" : false,
		"revert" : false
	},
