# Modular Code

## The Concept

- A FileMaker solution can have one file or many files.
- Each separate file only has access to its own Custom Functions, Table Occurrances and Relationships.
- Scripts is separate files can be called with parameters and can return results
- When developers commonly use the term modular code, they are referring to something like a Create New Record script, but this script cannot be copied from one file to another because the Table Occurrances will break and have to be repointed in each instance.
- The most advnced tool is the one we can continue to work on and hone, like a quality chef's knife.
- Advanced code cannot be built just once
- It must be iteracted on over and over
